## First things first 
Show of hands 
<h1>üôå</h1> 

---

## Hands up if you are... 
* Using Vite in production <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * With Vue2 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * With Vue3 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * With something else üëΩ<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
---

## and what about... 
* Having migrated a Vue2 app to Vite?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
---

## Good! 

<big>moving on...</big> <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

---
## The Problem

* Our app is built using Vue2
* That means it's built using webpack
* Which can become slow over time as complexity increases
* Really slow üêå<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

---
## The Problem in numbers

---
## `npm run serve`

```node
DONE  Compiled successfully in 90699ms

No type errors found
Version: typescript 4.0.5
Time: 33862ms
```

---
## `npm run serve`

* 90 seconds on average

* Would be fine if this happend once per day
  
Have breakfast <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  
Drop the kid at kindergarten <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

`npm run serve` <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

Right? <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

---
## Wrong

* Let's be pedantic
* 2022 has got 229 working days
  * Maybe not as many, second kid is due this year üçº
* Grand total of 5.725 hours wasted!
* That's almost a whole day's worth of work per year!

---
## Wronger still

Let's get real and execute a simple code change and watch the server reload

---
## Simple change I

```
DONE  Compiled successfully in 6503ms

Type checking in progress...
```

* 6 whole seconds
* But wait (no pun intented), it's still type checking!

---
## Simple change II

```
DONE  Compiled successfully in 6503ms

Type checking in progress...

  App running at:
  - Local:   secret localhost
  - Network: secret host 

No type errors found
Version: typescript 4.0.5
Time: 27550ms
```

* 27 seconds
* Waiting times are starting to compound
* I'm also being mean: the view does not wait for type checking to finish

---
## Time for some guesstimates

* 20 changes per hour
* 8 hours per day
* 6 seconds per change on average
* That adds up to 24 minutes waiting per day
* Remember those 229 working days?

---
## Waste

* That's almost 92 hours wasted per year
* Not so pedantic now

---
##

![xkcd_compiliing](media/compiling.png)

---
## It gets worse

* We use a containerized development enviroment
* That means node also runs inside a container
* Works fine for 99% of devs at Infraspeak
* Except for me and another poor soul
* Neither of us is using vanilla Ubuntu
  * He uses Mint
  * And I btw use Ar... Manjaro.
  * That's Arch Linux for dummies like me <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
## Happy mode

![wcc_ok](media/wcc-cpu-ok.png)

---
## Berserk mode

![wcc_nok](media/wcc-cpu-nok.png)

---
## Not happy

* Need to restart the node container
* Which takes 90 seconds on average
* But now multiple times a day
* Math time again!

---
## Just kidding

![zgm](media/ZachGalifianakisMath.gif)

<big>moving on...</big> <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
---
## We want happy devs 

* This can mean different things to different peop... developers
* Its not one size fits all
* If anything shortening the loop between writing code and seeing it happen is good 

---
## Defining DX

> There is nothing more directly DX than the experience of typing code into code editing software and running it. That‚Äôs what ‚Äúcoding‚Äù is and that‚Äôs what developers do. It‚Äôs no wonder that developers take that experience seriously and are constantly trying to improve it for themselves and their teams.

[CSS Tricks on DX](https://css-tricks.com/what-is-developer-experience-dx/#aa-people-think-of-the-literal-experience-of-coding)

---
## We could 

* Split up the app into modules
* Give each dev a beefy workstation
* Use other tricks to speed things up

---
## Or maybe... 

* Vite is all the rage right?
* It's super fast and efficient
* Why not use it and ditch webpack?

---
## Great timing! 

Now I have something to present at PortoVue!

![roll_safe](media/roll_safe.webp)

---
## But wait...

* Could we even use Vite?
* From what I had heard it was only for Vue3
* We didn't want to do that (not right now anyway)
  * ElementUI
  * Class based components (prob not a concern anymore)

---
## But how?

Let's see why Vite is so fast

<small>Cool digrams snatched from [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html#why-vite) and [esbuild.github.io](https://esbuild.github.io/)</small>

---
## Classic Bundlers

![bundle_dev_server](media/bundle_dev_server.png)

---
## ESM Bundlers

![esm_dev_server](media/esm_dev_server.png)

---
## Dependency Pre-Bundling  

![esbuild](media/esbuild.png)

notes:

* CommonJS and UMD compatibility: During development, Vite's dev serves all code as native ESM. Therefore, Vite must convert dependencies that are shipped as CommonJS or UMD into ESM first.
* Performance: Vite converts ESM dependencies with many internal modules into a single module to improve subsequent page load performance.

---
## Other tricks

* Route-based code splitting
* Native ESM on the browser
  * Efectively turning the browser into a bundler
  * dev server only
  * Bye bye IE (sorry not sorry)

---
## This felt possible

![mini goes boom](media/IS-mini-ls-engine.jpg)

---
## 

<h2 class="r-fit-text">BUT WEIRD!</h2>

---
## Ready, set, Vite!

---
## Ask the internet first

* Surely there must be a _simple_ way of doing this
  * According to Daniel Kelly of Vue School there is: [How to Migrate from Vue CLI to Vite](https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/how-to-migrate-from-vue-cli-to-vite/)
* Have guide, will follow! ü§ì

---
## Ignore old browsers

* Get rid of Babel
* Update `eslint` env from `node` to `es2021`

---
## Add vite.config.js

* Forget about `vue.config.js`
* Mapping is not straightforward
* This was a bit of trial and error
* And uh... reading the docs! üôÑ

---
## Move index.html

* With Vite `index.html` lives in the root folder
* Replace any webpack configs with hardcoded values

---
## Update scripts

* Replace `vue-cli-service` commands with `vite` ones

---
## Update env vars

* `import.meta.env.` takes the place of `process.env.`
* `VUE_APP_` prefix must be updated to `VITE_`

dist/assets/index.f330a991.js   0.73 KiB / gzip: 0.41 KiB
```

* 1.570 seconds? üî•
* 2 modules? ü§î

---
## That's too fast...

* Even for Vite
* Vite wasn't seeing the whole picture 
* `index.html` was using a `.js` loading script
* Swap the entry point with `src/main.ts`

---
## C'mon Vite... 

```
The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved:

  element-ui/types/form (imported by ...)
  element-ui/types/message-box (imported by ...)
  element-ui/types/collapse (imported by ...)
  ...
  element-ui/types/upload (imported by ...)
  element-ui/types/button (imported by ...)
  element-ui/types/form-item (imported by ...)

Are they installed?

---
## What? 

```
10 |    async changeLanguage(language) {
11 |      const langCode = getLanguageConfiguration(language).elementUi;
12 |      await import(`element-ui/lib/locale/lang/${langCode}`).then((elementLang) => {
   |                   ^
13 |        elementLocale.use(elementLang.default);
14 |      });
The above dynamic import cannot be analyzed by vite.
```

---
## No no... 

```
16 |    async changeLanguage(language) {
17 |      const langCode = getLanguageConfiguration(language).moment;
18 |      await import(`moment/locale/${langCode}`).then(() => {

## Oh boy

![whack](media/whack-a-mole.gif)

Here we go... <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

---
## So...

* Too many bugs ü¶ü
* Just comment the errors
* Fix them later YOLO

---
## Build it first

* Serve/fix loops would take forever
* A prod build should expose a decent amount of errors in one go
* Can also benchmark Vite builds against webpack

---
## Language files

* Add `.js` extension

---
## SASSy errors

* Comment all variable errors
* Will deal with this later
* Again... YOLO üòú

---
## Element UI

* CommonJS
* Hard dependency
* Only Element Plus supports Vue3

---
## Typescript type imports

![ts_type_import](media/ts_import_type.png)

---
## `import type`

* Fix all ElementUI type imports

```
PATTERN="(import)( \{.*\} from 'element-ui/types/.*'$)"
for f in $(rg -l "$PATTERN")
do rg "$PATTERN" --passthru -r '$1 type$2' $f | sponge $f
done

![CORS](media/CORS.png)

---
##

![CORS_zoom](media/CORS_zoom.png)

---
## Quick explanation

* CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources to be requested from a domain other than the one where the first resource was served
* The browser was atempting an XHR request to api.infraspeak.development 
* But using a port the api was not expecting
* Thus the request is denied üí©

---
## Know what?

![hackerman](media/hackerman.jpg) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes:

* CommonJS vs ESM
* Vite does away with CommonJS (can be added via plugins) to target only modern browsers

---
##

<img class="r-stretch" src="media/is_requests.png"/>

* We're good now!

---
## Poking around

* Doesn't feel _that_ fast
  * That's because Vite builds on demand
  * Will require further tweaking
* Only slow when first visiting a view

notes:

* More and better routing
* Async Components https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html#dynamic-components

---
## Did DX improve?

* Let's see how fast HMR is

---
## Simple benchmark

* We'll edit the same file over the same codebase
  * The original using webpack
  * The new and improved one using Vite
* Save both files at the same time
* Wait for HMR to kick in
